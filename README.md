# PhoneModelsConvertor
A simple PHP script converting smartphone/tablet device model into user friendly one
A simple convertDeviceModel($sourceModel) function that will retrieve phone model full name given model "code".
I have used and merged these 2 sources :
   https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Models
   http://storage.googleapis.com/play_public/supported_devices.csv

Current version : 2.0 List up to date 2018.10.03

Personnaly i used it on several ionic project (server side).
Could also work for native Android/iOS apps as "model" value is quite not userFriendly most of the time.
